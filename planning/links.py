"""Check every relative Markdown link and heading anchor in the repository.

Run via ``just check-links``. Exists because a site builder only validates the
directory it publishes: a repo's ``architecture/`` and ``planning/`` trees usually
sit outside it, are read on GitHub, and rot silently. In the repo this convention
came from, anchors in ``architecture/`` broke three times in one week, each caught
only by a human re-deriving slugs by hand.

Slugs follow **GitHub's** algorithm, because that is where these files are read —
including the ones a site builder also publishes. Where the two disagree, the fix
is to change the heading rather than to teach this checker both dialects: a heading
containing an em dash yields ``a--b`` on GitHub (the dash is dropped, both spaces
become hyphens) and ``a-b`` under python-markdown (the whitespace run collapses).

External links are not fetched; this checks the repository's internal consistency.
A relative link that resolves outside the repository is reported rather than followed:
it is a 404 on GitHub, and whether it resolves on disk depends on what the author
happens to have cloned next to the repo — a verdict a lint gate must never depend on.
